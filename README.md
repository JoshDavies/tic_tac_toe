# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Tech Test:
Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe by combining your code with any user interface, whether web or command line.

## Rules of tic-tac-toe

- There are two players in the game (X and O)
- Players take turns until the game is over
- A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
- A turn ends when a player claims a field

- A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
- A game is over if a player wins
- A game is over when all fields are taken

### Victory Conditions
'â‰¡' 3 horizontal possibilities  
'|||' 3 vertical possibilities  
'X' 2 diagonal possibilities  

## Quickstart
First, clone this repository. Then:

```bash
> bundle install
> rspec # Run the tests to ensure it works

> irb # to interact with the code via an IRB REPL.
```

## User Stories
